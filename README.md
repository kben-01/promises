# promises
1.  A promise is an object that can be resolved or rejected in the future. It is set in the code to either be fulfilled or rejected further down the line.

2.  We use promises to almost set expectations for a block of code to follow, it is promising us that one way or another this code will be done if called upon, whether it is rejected or resolved depends on the code written.

3.  The benefits of using promises is they can come in handy when building routes on an application, using the await function helps a lot for when you want code to only run when the user connects to a certain route.
